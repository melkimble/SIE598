Wielopole Skrzyńskie is located about 148 kilometers (92.5 miles) east of Kraków.
According to the 1921 census, there were 550 Jewish residents, constituting 54.7 percent of the total population of Wielopole Skrzyńskie.
Upon the village’s occupation, the Germans established a Judenrat chaired by Chaim Meller, together with Abraham Langer (treasurer) and Mendel Kanner.
In May 1940, the Judenrat reported 763 Jews, including 135 refugees, living in the village.
Of that number, 70 had arrived from Inowrocław in December 1939.
Other refugees were mostly from Łódź or other localities within Kreis Debica.
In late 1940 and 1941, dozens of Jews were sent to a forced labor camp in Pustków near Dębica.
The Gestapo from Dębica oversaw life in the village, and it often extorted valuables from its Jewish inhabitants.
According to A.
Rubin, the Germans executed two Jews caught outside the village buying food from farmers in January 1941.
On May 1, 1940, the Judenrat opened a soup kitchen.
It served on average 45 breakfasts and dinners per day.
On Saturdays those receiving food from the soup kitchen were assigned to local families for a meal.
The kitchen closed in November 1940 due to a lack of money.
It reopened briefly, only to close again in June 1941.
In March 1941, 112 Jews from Kraków were deported to Wielopole.
By mid-April 1941, their number had risen to 250, as some of the Kraków Jews who were initially assigned to Mielec were later directed to Wielopole.
In May 1941, the Judenrat wrote to the Jewish Social Self-Help (JSS) in Kraków, stating that none of the Jewish businesses were under trustee management.
In June 1941, a branch of the JSS was set up in Wielopole with three officials, Szaje Tajtelbaum (chairman), Chaim Mejer Lipschitz (deputy), and Jakub Barth.
It managed to reopen the kitchen on November 1, 1941, producing 70 meals daily.
Those who could afford it paid 10 groszy per meal; most customers received their meals for free.
Secondary sources date the establishment of the ghetto in the spring of 1942, at which time Jews were forbidden to live in certain parts of Wielopole and were resettled to a few narrow streets.
The ghetto was not enclosed, but its inhabitants’ freedom of movement was severely restricted.
In March 1942, approximately 170 Jews were deported to Mielec to work in aircraft factories.
Norbert Friedman testified that the Germans surrounded the village one day and announced that if men volunteered for the labor camps, their women and children would not be resettled.
Friedman was one such volunteer.
By May 1942, the JSS had found agricultural employment for 100 Jews.
They worked on the surrounding large estates, including in Mała (about 8 kilometers (5 miles) northwest of Wielopole) and other nearby homesteads.
The ghetto was liquidated on June 26, 1942, when the community was resettled to the ghetto in nearby Ropczyce.
In the course of the liquidation – or shortly thereafter – 50 to 56 elderly Jews were shot and buried in a mass grave at the Jewish cemetery.
Some of them were brought from the village of Mała.
Among the victims were: Arszcz Schaja Hiller, Feiga Mała Hiller, and Samuel Leidner.
The ghetto in Ropczyce was liquidated on July 23, 1942, when the majority of its population was escorted to the nearby town of Sędziszów and then deported to the Bełżec extermination camp.
