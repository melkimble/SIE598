Ołpiny is located approximately 30 kilometers (19 miles) northwest of Jasło.
There were 185 Jews living there in 1921, out of a total population of 2,674.
The Germans appointed a Jewish council (Judenrat) chaired by Chaskiel Machler.
Benjamin Wróbel served as the Judenrat’s secretary.
In May 1940, there were 225 Jews in Ołpiny, including 50 refugees from Łódź who settled there in December 1939.
In describing the community’s situation at the time, the Judenrat wrote to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (AJDC) that Ołpiny’s Jews are no longer engaged in any kind of trade, which had been their main prewar source of income.
According to Arnon Rubin, the Germans restricted the freedom of movement of all Jews soon after the occupation, allowing them to go only to the nearest village, and so depriving them of their means of income.
The Judenrat delivered 30 Jews a day for forced labor.
It also collected money and valuables at the Germans’ request.
In February 1941, the Judenrat reported 299 Jewish residents.
A number of Jews were receiving some food from surrounding estates owned by Poles.
According to Mieczysław Wieliczko, historian of Jasło County, the process of ghettoization in the Kreis was completed in 1941, while some Jews were still allowed to live in villages.
One of the ghettos established around that time was in Ołpiny.
Wieliczko established that in the spring of 1942, part of the Jewish population from the ghetto in Ołpiny was moved to Jasło and to Biecz.
Rubin, who maintains that no ghetto was established in Ołpiny, dates the resettlement to Biecz in the summer of 1942.
Prior to this deportation (June and July 1942), 40 men were sent to the labor camp in Płaszów.
The remaining 120 men, women, and children were taken on August 9, 1942 to the Dąbry Forest near Rzepiennik Biskupi and shot there.
